# Train Booking API

This is a Train Booking API that allows users to book seats on a train. The API follows certain rules and algorithms to handle seat reservations in a coach.

## Front-End
You can check out the front-end of the project at [Train-WebApp](https://github.com/Vi-r-us/Train-WebApp). It provides a user interface to interact with the Train Booking API and perform seat reservations.

## Functionality
The Train Booking API provides the following functionality:

- The train has 80 seats in a coach, arranged in rows. Each row has 7 seats, except for the last row which has only 3 seats.
- Users can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
- The API prioritizes booking seats in one row if available.
- If seats in one row are not available, the booking algorithm will attempt to book nearby seats.
- Users can book as many tickets as they want until the coach is full.
